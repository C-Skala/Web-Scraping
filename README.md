# Web-Scraping
What was the biggest challenge of scraping the web site?
- that darn pop up. I did not even think that could be an issue.

What insight, if any, did you gain from the analysis and visualization of the laptop data?
-honestly the data shows no hard correlation. I was hoping that there would be correlation between price and number of reviews but if anything it only showed 2 large groupings of prices that have a larger amount of reviews. you might be able to say that the price range of 300-600 and 1100-1400 have more purchases because thats where a majority of the reviews fall but as far as there being a true price winner i cant say.
